# Semantic Segmentation based Data Augmentation Techniques for Anomaly Detection of Concrete Structures

Although innovative achievements are being made in various fields due to advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies, 
there are still limitations in learning models using limited quantities and types of datasets. 
This paper proposes a Semantic Segmentation based Data Augmentation Techniques for Anomaly Detection of Concrete Structures. 
The proposed method extracts the defect part through semantic segmentation, 
and synthesizes objects and backgrounds through random positioning and alpha synthesis to generate an image dataset containing various backgrounds and defect combinations. 
This method was evaluated using Dice Score and IoU Score, and as a result of the experiment, 
this method shows higher performance than the existing method, 
so it can be applied practically in the field of detecting defects in concrete structures.
